when we detect something, we know what to do... the question is detecting that we have detected ... :)

first order of business should be getting the debug framework right - Damn!! that is what lets you
do a little bit every day!! What a moment of insight!!!!

You have to document also what the coder has in his working memory - else, when you 
read the stuf after 2 months, you don't know what's what.

If you have this info, then you can invest the time in the right amount of reverse engineering..



Whoopsie daisy, how are we planning on handling strings baby?

Woke up today with the realization that my analyze routine will have to communicate # of matches - else
how do I know what nArgs or nLocals are?
