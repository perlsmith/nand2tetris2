when we detect something, we know what to do... the question is detecting that we have detected ... :)

first order of business should be getting the debug framework right - Damn!! that is what lets you
do a little bit every day!! What a moment of insight!!!!

You have to document also what the coder has in his working memory - else, when you 
read the stuf after 2 months, you don't know what's what.

If you have this info, then you can invest the time in the right amount of reverse engineering..


Whoopsie daisy, how are we planning on handling strings baby? -- you have to read the Jack API and then
you'll know all about strings - since you can only work with 16 bits at a time, you have to contruct the
string with sequence of calls to String.appendChar -- String is a class.. -- this being the case, why
the hell didn't they mention this in the lecture?

Woke up today with the realization that my analyze routine will have to communicate # of matches - else
how do I know what nArgs or nLocals are?

plan for the day :

go through every rule and add psuedocode for dealing with that rule
